	abstract = {We examined the propagation of an infectious disease and the eventual extinction of the host population in a lattice-structured population. Both the host colonization and pathogen transmission processes are assumed to be restricted to act between the nearest neighbor sites. The model is analyzed by an improved version of pair approximation (IPA). Pair approximation is a technique to trace the dynamics of the number of nearest neighbor pairs having particular states, and IPA takes account of the clustering property of lattice models more precisely. The results are checked by computer simulations. The analysis shows: (i) in a one-dimensional lattice population, a pathogen cannot invade a host population no matter how large is the transmission rate; (ii) in a two-dimensional lattice population, pathogens will drive the host to extinction if the transmission rate is larger than a threshold. These results indicate that spatially structured population models may give qualitatively different results from conventional population models, such as Lotka-Volterra ones, without spatial structure.},

	abstract = {Why are some discases more virulent than others? Vector-borne diseases such as malaria and water-borne diseases such as cholera are generally more virulent than diseases spread by direct contagion. One factor that characterizes both vector- and water-borne diseases is their ability to spread over long distances, thus causing infection of susceptible individuals distant from the infected individual. Here we show that this ability of the pathogen to infect distant individuals in a spatially structured host population leads to the evolution of a more virulent pathogen. We use a lattice model in which reproduction is local but infection can vary between completely local to completely global. With completely global infection the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the same as in mean-field models while a lower virulence is predicted as infection becomes more local. There is characteristically a period of relatively moderate increase in virulence followed by a more rapid rise with increasing proportions of global infection as we move beyond a 'critical connectivity'. In the light of recent work emphasizing the existence of 'small world' networks in human populations, our results suggests that if the world is getting 'smaller'--as populations become more connected--diseases may evolve higher virulence.},
